  <h1>YEAH MAN</h1>
  <body>
    <p>Working on a new project and i am trying to test my skills in coding.Thing is with coding you always have to sharpen your skills so that you dont get rusty. Today is just a reminder of some of the things i have learnt so far.</p>
    <p>So far, so good; i am enjoying what i am doing and my progress so far. There is light at the end of the tunnel and things will work out.</p>
